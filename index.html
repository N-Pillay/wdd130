    <h2>Niven Pillay</h2>
    <h2>(Niv)</h2>
    <p>My name is Niven Pillay. I was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. However, I’ve recently moved to the United Kingdom. Currently, I live in Manchester.
        Living alone in a new country can have many challenges, but I’m optimistic about the future. </p>
        
        <p>I have a small family, mainly keeping in contact with my mom and dad. I am not married. I am a member of the Church of Jesus 
            Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I was baptised in 2015, and the hymn I’d chosen for my baptism was “High on a Mountain Top”. 
            My favourite scripture is Doctrine and Covenants 6:36, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”. </p>

            <p>I studied at the University of Pretoria and earned a diploma in veterinary nursing. I’m working in the UK as a 
                registered veterinary nurse. My goal would be to attain a bachelor's degree from BYU-I, hoping to use my academic 
                credentials to apply for veterinary medicine and finally achieve my dream of becoming a full-fledged veterinarian.</p>

                <p>I am currently enrolled in the BS Applied Technology degree course. The web fundamentals course would be a stepping
                     stone toward designing websites. With the added courses from my degree, I would be learning both front and back-end 
                     development. These skills, although unrelated to my field of work, add dynamics and alternate forms of thinking which 
                     I feel would be beneficial in the field of veterinary medicine.</p>
